# Crowdfunding_ETL

Hello. This is Project 2 of Data Analytics Bootcamp. This project is done by Abeda Salsabil and Han Yu.

The jupyter notebooks are found in the folder named Starter_Files. The first two parts (Category and Subcategory DataFrames & Campaign DataFrame), completed by Abeda can be found in ASalsabil.ipnyb. The third part (Contacts DataFrame) completed by Han can be found in HanYu.ipnyb. Lastly is the Crowdfunding Database, completed by Han, also found in the Starter_Files folder. 

The updated campaign and contacts csv files can be found in the Resources folder (within Starter_Files), along with the newly made category and subcateory csv files.

We would like to thank our instructor and TA's 'for teaching us how to clean and transform data. This has been a fun project to complete. Happy coding!
